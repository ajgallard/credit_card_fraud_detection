# Credit Card Fraud Detection


This repo is an exercise in utilizing both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to detect cases of credit card fraud.

The primary objective is to showcase how we might begin the process of generating models under supervised and unsupervised cases, 
how to measure the success of each model generated, and what next steps would need to be taken given the results

## Notable Topics

This repo explores concepts suchs as:
* Random Forest
* Isolation Forest
* Local Outliers Factor
* Precision, Recall, Accuracy & F1-Scores
* Unbalanced Datasets
* RandomizedSearchCV & GridSearchCV
